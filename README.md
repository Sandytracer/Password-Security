## 1. Objective
To create strong passwords, evaluate their strength using online tools, and understand best practices for secure authentication.

---

## 2. Methodology
- Created multiple passwords with varying complexity.  
- Tested them using **PasswordMeter** and **Kaspersky Password Checker**.  
- Compared scores and feedback.  
- Researched password attacks and prevention.

## 3. Results

| Password Example              | Tool Used        | Strength | Estimated Crack Time |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| `password123`                 | PasswordMeter   | Very Weak | Seconds             |
| `Password2025`                | Kaspersky       | Weak      | Hours               |
| `P@ssw0rd!2025`               | PasswordMeter   | Strong    | Years               |
| `Gr33n_Tree$2025!SecureLife`  | Kaspersky       | Very Strong | Centuries+        |

## 4. Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Use **12+ characters**.  
2. Mix letters, numbers, and special symbols.  
3. Avoid personal info & dictionary words.  
4. Use **passphrases** (easy to remember, hard to guess).  
5. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.  
6. Use a **password manager** for complex/unique passwords.  

---

## 5. Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tests all combinations.  
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses pre-compiled lists of common words.  
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials across websites.  

---

## 6. Conclusion
This task demonstrated how password complexity and length affect security. Testing across tools proved that simple passwords are easily cracked, while longer, complex passphrases offer strong protection. Combined with MFA and password managers, this ensures robust authentication practices.
